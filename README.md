# MPG-Regression-Analysis
This directory contains code and resources for investigating regression models on a dataset related to car fuel efficiency (miles per gallon, or MPG). The purpose of this project is to explore and analyze the relationship between various features of cars and their MPG values using regression techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis consists of a collection of cars and their corresponding attributes, such as cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, and origin. The target variable is the MPG, representing the fuel efficiency of each car.

## Prerequisites
Before running the Jupyter Notebook in this repository, you'll need the following:

Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Jupyter Notebook: You can install Jupyter Notebook using `pip` by running `pip install notebook`.

Python libraries: You will need several Python libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn (for machine learning), and others. You can install them using `pip` or `conda`. 
## Usage
1. Clone this using git:
`git clone git@github.com:havo2001/Regression-Analysis-using-MPG-dataset.git`
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook by running:
`jupyter notebook`
